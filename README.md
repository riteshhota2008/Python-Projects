# Python Projects

**Mortgage Calculator** - Calculate the monthly payments of a fixed term mortgage over given Nth terms at a given interest rate. Also figure out how long it will take the user to pay back the loan. For added complexity, add an option for users to select the compounding interval (Monthly, Weekly, Daily, Continually).

**Find PI to the Nth Digit** - Enter a number and have the program generate PI up to that many decimal places.

**Find e to the Nth Digit** - Just like the previous problem, but with e instead of PI. Enter a number and have the program generate e up to that many decimal places.

**Fibonacci Sequence** - Enter a number and have the program generate the Fibonacci sequence to that number or to the Nth number.
